# PocketBookDBHandler
Module for the plugin calibre.koplugin to the KOreader application. The program adds information about books sent via the Smart Device App protocol of the Calibre application to the PocketBook device database. This eliminates the need to reboot the device to find books in the reader's built-in library.
